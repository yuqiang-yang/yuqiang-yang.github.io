I am studying how to utilize robotics learning methods, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, to achieve high-level intelligence of different robots.

<p> &emsp;  This project is to allow the humanoid to learn a robust locomotion policy in complex environment. I deploy the learned policy into different simulation environment of Nvidia Isaac Sim and demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>
