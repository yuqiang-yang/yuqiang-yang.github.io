I have experience in the real-time perception, wholebody planning and control for mobile manipulators with differential base. Some videos about my projects and research on mobile manipulator are listed as follows. 
<center><h2>RAMPAGE: Towards Whole-body, Real-Time and Agile Motion Planning in Dynamic Cluttered Environments for Mobile Manipulators</h2></center>
<p> &emsp;  This research is to allow the mobile manipulator to finish manipulation tasks while avoiding the collision in 3D dynamic environment with only onboard sensing. More supplementary materials are <a href="https://github.com/yuqiang-yang/TIE-Supplementary-video">here</a>.</p>

<center><h2>Open the door while rejecting random disturbance with a mobile manipulator</h2></center>
<p>&emsp; Manually design a door-opening trajectory and use a whole-body admittance controller to track. By detecting the force on the end-effector of the mobile manipulator, the whole body can respond smoothly to external disturbance.</p>

<center><h2>Graceful wholebody pick-and-place for mobile manipulator</h2></center>
<p>&emsp; Jointly consider the manipulability, energy, manipulator orientation and path tracking in the QP solvers. The dynamic-weighted QP is implemented based on the tracking error to achieve graceful picking-and-placing. This project follows <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04749">this</a> work of Peter Corke.</p>

<center><h2>Learning the coordination motion of mobile manipulators through human demonstration</h2></center>
<p> &emsp;  This research is to allow the mobile manipulatorâ€™s skill learning process with features of large-scale convergence, coordination working and disturbance rejection, after just a few human demonstrations.</p>
