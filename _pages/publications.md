Some video of the projects are as follows. 

<center><h2>Learning the coordination motion of mobile manipulators through human demonstration</h2></center>
<p> &emsp;  This research is to allow the mobile manipulatorâ€™s skill learning process with features of large-scale convergence, coordination working and disturbance rejection, after just a few human demonstrations.</p>

<center><h2>Realtime wholebody control of the mobile manipulator in cluttered environment(TO DO)</h2></center>
<p>&emsp;The goal of this project is to enable mobile manipulators to plan and execute the manipulation in real-time in a cluttered environment.</p>

<br>
<center><h2>Graceful wholebody pick-and-place for mobile manipulator</h2></center>
<p>&emsp; Jointly consider the manipulability, energy, manipulator orientation and path tracking in the QP solvers. The dynamic-weighted QP is implemented based on the tracking error to achieve graceful picking-and-placing.</p>

<center><h2>Self-balanced smart car with wireless charging capability</h2></center>
<p>&emsp; This is our team's video in the national competition.</p>
