I am Yuqiang Yang, a master candidate at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), supervised by [Dr. Chenguang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e8io0fYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Now I am also working as an intern at Application Innovate Laboratory, [Huawei Technologies Co.Ltd](www.huawei.com).

My research interests are robotic learning from demonstration, mobile manipulation and whole-body control. Specifically, I have been exploring and exploiting the potentiality of the wheeled mobile manipulators in acquiring manipulation skills from human demonstration, such as picking-and-placing or openning the door. Recently I am working on the wholebody control of the wheeled mobile maniputors through SLQ-MPC controller implemented in [OCS2](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/ocs2). This goal of this project is to enable mobile manipulators to plan and execute the manipulation in real time in a cluttered environment.

## Biography
I have been a member of Chenguang Yang's [Advanced Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/advr/index.html) since 2021, after I graduated from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) with the bachelor's degree at [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
