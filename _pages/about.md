I am Yuqiang Yang, a master candidate at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), supervised by [Prof. Chenguang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e8io0fYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Now I am also working as an intern at Application Innovate Laboratory, [Huawei Technologies Co.Ltd](www.huawei.com).

My research interests are **wholebody planning and control** for different robots such as **mobile manipulator, multicopter and car**. Specifically, I have been exploring and exploiting the potentiality of the wheeled mobile manipulators to avoiding collision aggressively in a wholebody manner and finishing pick-and-place task in 3d cluttered dynamic environment. Besides, I am working towards the low-cost and efficient mapping, planning and control framework for **multicopter** in unstructed environment. I have sufficient engineering experience on deploying algorithms in various robotic scenarios such as agile collision avoidance, pedestrian following and picking-placing. The goal of my research is to endow robots with **agile mobility and manoeuvrability** in a 3d cluttered **dynamic** environment.

## Research Experiences
**RAMPAGE: Towards Whole-body, Real-Time and Agile Motion Planning in Dynamic Cluttered Environments for Mobile Manipulators**
<div style="float:left; text-align:left">Application Innovate Laboratory, Huawei</div> <div style="float:right; text-align:right"><i>2022.10 - present</i></div>  
<br />
Advisor: Dr. Chen Chen
<ul>
<li>
    A novel hierarchical topology-guided searching method for the MMs is developed to find an initial whole-body kinodynamic trajectory in real time (30ms).
</li>
<li>
  <p> We derive and implement a whole-body trajectory optimization method which naturally integrates the planning and control module (IPC) in an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) form.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>We make use of a real-time constructed ESDF map to achieve low-cost high-speed collision calculation against dynamic obstacles in batch, with the MM body being approximated by sphere decomposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
Benchmark
comparisons and extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed framework can plan whole-body collision-free
trajectories in real-time with a high success rate and accurately execute them at an average speed of 1.86m/s among
dynamic obstacles with a maximum speed of 2m/s
</li>
</ul>

**Learning the coordination motion of mobile manipulators through human demonstration**
<div style="float:left; text-align:left">School of Automation Science and Engineering, SCUT</div> <div style="float:right; text-align:right"><i>2022.01 - 2022.09</i></div>
<p> <br />
Advisor: Prof. Chenguang Yang</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>Propose a
whole-body LfD framework through Gaussian Process, which
endows the mobile manipulatorâ€™s skill learning process with
features of large-scale convergence, coordination working and
disturbance rejection, after just a few human demonstrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>An
efficient kinesthetic teaching method is devised based on the
weighted least-norm (WLN) inverse kinematics solution and an
admittance controller, which facilitates human users to guide
the mobile manipulator to perform tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> The framework allows for human-in-the-loop correction when the whole-body is conducting a task.</p>
</li>
</ul>

## Project Experiences

<ul>
<li>
  <p> We design and implement a low-cost efficient occupancy grid map (OGM) updating algorithm with the features of incremental inflation and spatial-temporal sliding windows. This enables a fast occupancy infomation update in large environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> The volumetric projection operator is accelerated through algorihtm decomposition in nerual processing unit. </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> A robot-centric ESDF (RC-ESDF) is utilized to represent the collision cost in the back-end optimization of our model prediected contour control problem (MPCC). This lazy evaluation strategy saves many times and calculations, allowing to plan and excute agressive trajectory in unknown environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> Construct a safe flight corridor (SFC) consisting of many convex polytopes. Then MINCO trajectory will be optimized and executed with a finely tuned controller considering the full dynamics to make the multicoter cross a narrow gap. </p>
</li>

  <p> We filter the object pointcloud of OUSTER lidar based on the bounding box generated by the visual perception. After then, the regristerd pointcloud by Fast-Lio2 will be considered as obstacles.</p>

</li>
<li>
  <p> Control the position and orientation of the two-wheeled car to complete a complex race track with different elements such as circles and slopes. The perception information mainly comes from the onboard IMU and electromagnetic sensors.</p>
