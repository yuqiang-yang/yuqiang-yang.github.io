I am Yuqiang Yang, a master candidate at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), supervised by [Prof. Chenguang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e8io0fYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Now I am also working as an intern at Application Innovate Laboratory, [Huawei Technologies Co.Ltd](www.huawei.com).

My research interests are robotic learning from demonstration, mobile manipulation and whole-body control. Specifically, I have been exploring and exploiting the potentiality of the wheeled mobile manipulators in acquiring manipulation skills from human demonstration, such as picking-and-placing or openning the door. Recently I am working on the wholebody control of the wheeled mobile maniputors through SLQ-MPC controller implemented in [OCS2](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/ocs2). This goal of this project is to enable mobile manipulators to plan and execute the manipulation in real time in a cluttered environment.

<ul>
<li>
   Construct the occupancy grid map and ESDF based on <a href="https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FIESTA" title="FIESTA">FIESTA</a>. Then bias the sample of RRT* to get an initial guiding path according to the topological map in Cartesian space. 
</li>
<li>
  <p> Propose and analyse the adaptive MPC theorectically to improve the convergence and optimality in complex environments where multiple non-convex costs or contraints exist</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>The proposed framework is verified through experiments about picking and placing a cup gracefully in clutted environment.</p>
</li>

Advisor: Prof. Chenguang Yang</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>Propose a
whole-body LfD framework through Gaussian Process, which
endows the mobile manipulatorâ€™s skill learning process with
features of large-scale convergence, coordination working and
disturbance rejection, after just a few human demonstrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>An
efficient kinesthetic teaching method is devised based on the
weighted least-norm (WLN) inverse kinematics solution and an
admittance controller, which facilitates human users to guide
the mobile manipulator to perform tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> The framework allows for human-in-the-loop correction when the whole-body is conducting a task.</p>
