I am Yuqiang Yang, a master student at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), supervised by [Prof. Chenguang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e8io0fYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research interests are to explore and exploit the potentiality of various robots, such as **mobile manipulator, autonomous car and multicopter**, to perform tasks autonomously and efficiently in unstructured environment. 
<!-- The goal of my research is to endow robots with **agile mobility and manoeuvrability** in a 3d cluttered **dynamic** environment. -->
   
Specifically, I have explored and realized the posibility of allowing the mobile manipulators to efficiently pick and place in a **wholebody** manner while avoidance collision smoothly **in cluttered dynamic environment** full of chairs, tables and shelves. Besides, I am working towards the low-cost and accurate state estimation (Visual Inertial Odometry) , mapping (Occupancy Grid Map and Euclidean Signed Distance Field), planning and control (SE3) framework for **quadrotor** in complex environments. For **autonomous car** with non-holonomic constraints, I investigated the **real-time** perception, mapping and collision-free motion planning to follow and serve the target person well. I have sufficient engineering experience on deploying algorithms in various robotic scenarios such as environmental reconstrunction, household service and car racing, etc.

<ul>
<li>
    A novel <b>hierarchical topology-guided</b> searching method for the MMs is developed to find an initial whole-body kinodynamic trajectory in real time (30ms), striking the balance in the success rate and the efficiency.
</li>
<li>
  <p> We derive and implement a whole-body trajectory optimization method which naturally <b>integrates the planning and control module</b> (IPC) in an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) form.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>We make use of a <b>real-time constructed ESDF map</b> to achieve low-cost high-speed collision calculation against dynamic obstacles in batch, with the MM body being approximated by <b>sphere decomposition</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
Benchmark
comparisons and extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed framework can plan whole-body collision-free
trajectories in real-time with a high success rate and accurately execute them at an <b>average speed of 1.86m/s</b> among
dynamic obstacles with a maximum speed of 2m/s.

<li>
  <p>Propose a
whole-body learning from demonstration framework through <b>Gaussian Process</b>, which
endows the mobile manipulatorâ€™s skill learning process with
features of large-scale convergence, coordination working and
disturbance rejection, after just <b>a few human demonstrations</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>An
efficient kinesthetic teaching method is devised based on the
<b>weighted least-norm (WLN)</b> inverse kinematics solution and an
admittance controller, which facilitates human users to guide
the mobile manipulator to perform tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> The framework allows for human-in-the-loop correction when the whole-body is conducting a task.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> We also implement a model-based and efficient <b>door openning</b> for mobile manipulator, even under <b>random disturbance</b>.</p>
