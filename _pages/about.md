I am Wenbin HU, a Ph.D student in robotic grasping and manipulation at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr. Zhibin Li](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/advr/index.html)(principal supervisor) and [Prof. Taku Komura](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/taku)(second supervisor). 

My research interests are learning-based robotic grasping and manipulation. Specifically, I have been exploring and exploiting the potentiality of deep reinforcement learning in acquiring responsive manipulation skills, such as grasping moving objects or catching flying objects. Recently I am working on the in-hand manipulation with tactile feedback, where compared with policy learning in simulation, the sim-to-real transfer is more challenging.

## Biography

I have been a member of Zhibin Li's [Advanced Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/advr/index.html) since 2018, after I graduated from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) with the bachelor's degree at [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
