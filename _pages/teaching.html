<center><h2>Pedestrian following and collision avoidance with spatial-temporal optimization for differential car
</h2></center>
<p>&emsp; A multi-level hybrid A* algorithm is used to find intial kinodynamic trajecory to the future position (predicted by EKF) in a certain horizon. It considers the object occlusion, uncertainty and collision simultaneously. 
  The initial trajectory parameterized by MINCO is optimized spatially and temporally. A low-level MPC considering the kinematics and communication delay is implemented to accurately track the planning trajecoty.

<center><h2>Collision avoidance for quadruped</h2></center>
<p>&emsp; This is a toy example. We use the same framework for differential car to plan the linear and angular velocity of the quadruped.
  Then the velocity is controlled by the high-level API of Unitree A1.
